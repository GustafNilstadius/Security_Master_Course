2. It is vounrable in /nightclub/girldetail.php
It takes one parameter (girl) that can be injected with sql. 
Example: Claudia' or '1'='1
Will give all girl in the bpr.girl table

3. The tables: girls, users, news 
I first tried with "UNION ALL SELECT 1, 2, 3 FROM information_schema WHERE '1'='1"
I got a acces decliend reply. 
I realised my error and modified the querry to " UNION ALL SELECT table_schema,table_name,null FROM information_schema.tables WHERE '1'='1".
This gave me all the tables in the database, including system databases.
